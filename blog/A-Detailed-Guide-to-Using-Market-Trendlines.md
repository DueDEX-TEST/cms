Trendline is among the most frequent concepts that used in technical analysis for conditional as well as crypto markets. Not as complex as other market terms and theories, trendline is intuitive and easy to understand, while at the same time, useful. Today we will cover basic knowledge that all traders should understand regarding trendline to facilitate your trades.

## What is trendline?

Trendline is a line drawn on the candlestick charts that connects different price points during certain period of time, making it more intuitive for traders to tell the price movement and so as to analyze the support level and resistance level, and predict the trend.

Trendlines can be divided into two types: uptrend and downtrend.Uptrend line has a positive slope and the downtrend line has a negative slope. The bigger the slope is, the stronger the trend is.

The time frame of the chart can be quite flexible, from daily, weekly, monthly to even yearly. The trendline based on that can also represent the trend for different duration, according to traders' long term or short term analysis.

One key point here is that the uptrend line is connecting two or more lows while the downtrend line is connecting highs.

## How to draw a Trendline?

Although based on the concept, two points can form a trendline, but it is agreed among traders that it requires at least three points to make a trendline valid.

To draw an uptrend line, draw a line from the lowest low, up and to the second highest low point preceding the highest low, making sure the trendline does not pass through prices between the low points. The downtrend line is drawn in a similar way and focusing on highs.

You can refer to the chart above as a detailed example. The blue uptrend line starts from the lowest low and up to the second highest low point preceding the highest low and the red line starts from the highest high and down to the lowest minor high point preceding the lowest low point.

In real cases, the first two points are often selected to define a possible trend, and the third point from the future market will be used to test its validity. When the future price falls on the trendline three or more times without breaching it, the trend can be considered valid.

## How to use a trendline?

The trendline provides insights into the supply and demand relationship. Uptrend lines indicates an increasing buying force while the downtrend lines suggest the opposite situation, that supply is higher than demand.

Therefore, traders may choose to enter a long position near the trendline. If the price action breaches the trendline on the downside, the trader can use that as a signal to close the position. This is a helpful method for traders to select an entry point and exit it when the trend is weakening.

Closing thoughts

Despite the fact that trendline is a good tool and experienced technical traders are using it to assist their trades, trend lines are far from perfect. The choice of points used is quite a subjective work and will affect the degree to which they accurately reveal the real market trends.

Trendlines that describes short-term trend can be volume sensitive. A trendline formed on low volume may easily be breached when volume increases.
