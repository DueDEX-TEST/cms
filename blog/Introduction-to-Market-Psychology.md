Traders are always trying to find the truth beyond the charts and prices so that they can preview the trend and make better decisions to buy and sell. Market Psychology is one of the popular theories along with fundamental analysis and technical analysis in traditional stock market. Today we will introduce the basics of market psychology, as well as how it impacts the crypto market to help traders optimize their trading outcome.

## What is Market Psychology?

Market Psychology is the theory that price changes in the market are influenced by the emotional conditions of the participants. The emotion of the groups, which is called the market sentiment, contributes to the shifts of financial markets and creates the market cycles.

When the market's sentiment is positive, and prices are rising, leading to a so-called bullish trend. The opposite is called a bear market, when the sentiment is negative.

As mentioned, the market’s sentiment is contributed by all market participants, no single opinion can be dominant. It means that the market sentiment is constantly changing which leads to the similar movement of the price of an asset, adding to the difficulty of the analysis and doing a trade.

## How is the market sentiment working on market?

The picture above shows the change of the market sentiment during an entire market cycle. As the price increases, the market sentiment goes more and more positive which in turn, drives the market to go up higher. In this case, many traders become so greedy that they are losing judgement of the asset’s real value, believing that they can make constant profits.

As the price gets higher, a peak will be reached. This is the moment when traders are facing the biggest risk.

When the market starts to go down, the euphoric mood turns doubtful as no one believes that the bull market is over. As prices continue to decline, the market sentiment changes to negative, from anxiety, denial, fear to desperation.

At the anxiety stage, traders begin to doubt if the bull market is still there. Followed by denial period, marked towards the feeling of unacceptance. Many traders decide to hold their assets at this stage, either because of their profits have turned into loss or they believe the bullish market is coming back soon. But as the prices drop even further, fear and panic make them give up and sell their holdings.

Finally, the downtrend will stop and the market stabilize. The market steps into the accumulation stage before the market sentiments become positive again.

## Market Psychology of Bitcoin Market

Different from traditional markets, Bitcoin market is more versatile and changing. It is also a vivid example of how the market psychology can influence the movement of the market. In the year 2017, bitcoin starts from $900 to nearly $20,000, all crypto participants and communities are filled with positive feelings. In 2018, the market begins to turn down and the market sentiment went from joy to denial. People still insisted their HODLing strategy. The market didn’t see any improvements and people started to get panic and sell. Finally in 2020, with some positive news such as bitcoin halving, the market became popular again. We have witnessed the restart of a lot of projects and communities since the beginning of this year.

People have also launched relevant projects to monitor the market sentiment of bitcoin industry. They are collecting data from the industry and build up their own algorithm to reveal the group emotions.

## Closing thoughts

Psychology plays an important role on market prices and cycles. By analyzing the market psychology, traders can more or less preview the trend of the market. However, it is a complex process to get the accurate results to refer to and people have different judgement of which stage the market is currently staying in. It requires a long time of trading experience and learning.
