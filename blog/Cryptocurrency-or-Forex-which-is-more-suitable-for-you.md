Nowadays, trading cryptocurrency or forex sounds like a way to get rich. But if you are a beginner, you may hesitate about which type of trading may suit you better. Crypto trading is generally considered similar to forex trading because forex trading also involves currency trading. But still, there are some key differences between the two.

<!--truncate-->

Forex trading is large and mature, while crypto trading is relatively new in the market. Crypto transactions do not require any intermediaries, while foreign exchange transactions usually involve intermediaries, brokers, and institutions that charge fees at each transaction step.

Since the invention of Bitcoin, the trading market has changed. The success of cryptocurrency traders has brought huge hype for buying and trading digital currencies. Therefore, this article can provide you with a guide on what are the differences between the two and which may be more suitable to you.

**Forex market**

The foreign exchange market is the largest trading market in the world. It is open 5 days a week, runs 24 hours a day, and has a daily transaction volume of approximately US$5 trillion. The foreign exchange market includes banks, enterprises, financial institutions, retail investors, and all exchange currency institutions engaged in trading or profit-making.

There are many factors that can affect the foreign exchange market, which may include specific factors such as GDP, inflation, and unemployment. And this is why traders use the economic calendar to follow up on such information and economic events that may affect the market.

**Cryptocurrency market**

The cryptocurrency market was born after the creation of Bitcoin in 2009. With the opening of cryptocurrency exchanges and the rise of various altcoins, a huge digital asset trading ecosystem has quickly formed. But the crypto market is still very young. It is open 7 days a week and runs 24 hours a day.

The current daily trading volume of the crypto market is approximately US$100 billion. The trading regulations of cryptocurrency exchanges also vary according to different regulations related to cryptocurrencies in different regions of the world. Generally speaking, the crypto market is less affected by global economic events or traditional financial markets. Traders don't often pay attention to news reports but pay more attention to charts and analysis.

**The difference between forex and cryptocurrency**

Foreign exchange transactions are usually carried out by brokers. You can get an account with direct access to the market, but the account will be strictly regulated. Therefore, for most traders and investors, it is more convenient to trade through a broker, but the broker will charge a certain fee. How much you are charged depends on many factors, such as the trading pair you choose, the actual institution involved, current market conditions, etc.

Cryptocurrencies are usually purchased on exchanges. Exchanges act as intermediaries and profit from them. Unlike brokers, exchanges, as a single institution for buying and selling, usually have a fixed exchange rate. Since there is no need to negotiate, just comply with the terms of the exchange, this simplifies the process for users. With the development of the blockchain technology, the so-called decentralized exchange has come into the market, in which there are no central intermediary and individuals trade cryptocurrencies on the platform directly to each other back by blockchain technology.

Traditional currencies or fiat currencies can be pegged to assets or other currencies, and they are regulated by the government and the central bank. The value of global currencies depends on the goods they produce and how their countries perform in competition with other global players.

On the other hand, cryptocurrencies were not even born ten years ago, and they are not properly managed by a certain country or bank. Although they can be anchored with other assets, yet most are not. They rely on the combination of their own utility and speculative beliefs to be evaluated. Digital currencies have their own uses, and different cryptocurrencies correspond to different projects.

**Which market is best for you?**

After understanding the two markets, you must be wondering, which one should I choose? Foreign exchange trading has a deeper foundation and clear supervision. And cryptocurrency is a new and risky market. Therefore, whether you choose foreign exchange trading or cryptocurrency, you must understand that every transaction has its own risks and rewards, as well as its positive and negative sides.

One might say that foreign exchange has a long history and is, therefore, more protected, more stable, and more regulated. However, cryptocurrency transactions can obtain higher returns than foreign exchange. The two markets have some similarities. For example, they are both forms of electronic currency transactions. Therefore, a computer device that can be connected to the Internet is required.

Cryptocurrency is a limited asset, which makes it more popular and in high demand. Cryptocurrency has the following benefits compared to traditional assets.

·Anonymous

·High growth potential

·High return

·Low barriers to entry

·Low transaction cost

·Gradually accepted by mainstream society

The size, structure and behavior of the two markets are different. The volatility of the crypto market and the liquidity of the foreign exchange market indicate that traders need to use different trading strategies for the two markets. So which market is best for you depends on you.

Due to the recent growth in the digital asset market, many foreign exchange traders have turned to trade cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the decision to trade cryptocurrency or forex depends on your purposes, resources and risk tolerance.
