The triangle formation is one of the continuous forms. During the formation of the form, it is a vibrating form in the trend development. When the vibrating is completed, it will continue the original trend. But in a few cases, the triangular pattern may also reveal the reversing trend.

The triangular pattern suggests that prices are brewing. In foreign exchange transactions, ascending triangles, descending triangles, and symmetrical triangles are important price patterns that are used for analysis more frequently.

**Ascending triangle**

Generally speaking, ascending is a bullish pattern, but it may continue in every direction. If you are trader with high risk preference, you can go long immediately after seeing this pattern. But if you prefer to be cautious and conservative, it is recommended that you wait until it continues with any clear direction before proceeding.

The most important part of the ascending triangle is the horizontal line and the upward slash. In addition, it is also important to remember that before the actual trend occurs, the price must touch these lines at least twice.

You can see in the chart that the price touched the slash three times, the horizontal line twice and then broke through the horizontal line. Stop loss should be set slightly below the horizontal line, considering a moderate retreat may occur.

**Descending triangle**

The descending triangle is a bearish continuous pattern, but it may break through in every direction. As with the previous pattern, high risk preference traders can short right after seeing a descending triangle. If you are cautiously conservative traders, you can wait for a breakthrough to identify a clearer direction.

The most important part of the descending triangle is the horizontal line and the downward slope. Before a breakout occurs, the price must touch these lines at least twice. As shown, the price hits the slash three times, the horizontal line twice, and then breaks down.

The descending triangle pattern is formed by lower highs and horizontal support; this means that short orders make the price go lower and lower, and the pressure on horizontal support increases. If the price breaks the downward in a downward trend, it means that the price will fall further. If the descending triangle breaks in an uptrend, it means the market is building a roof.

**Symmetrical triangle**

Like the other two triangles, the symmetrical triangle is also a continuous pattern, and it breaks in the direction of the previous trend. However, in fact, it may break through in every direction. As always, when this triangle is found, risk appetites can immediately decide to open positions in the direction of the previous trend. If you are a prudent and conservative trader, you can wait until a clear trend before placing orders.

The most important part of a symmetrical triangle is the downward slash, the upward slash, and the horizontal line that bisects the angle formed by the two lines. The horizontal line should be in a true horizontal direction (subtle mistakes are acceptable), otherwise this is not a symmetrical triangle.

According to the usual rules, before a breakout occurs, the price should touch each main slash at least twice. The symmetrical triangle in the picture breaks after touching the bottom line three times and the top line multiple times.

Symmetrical triangles are the most neutral of the three forms, with higher lows and lower highs constructed towards a certain vertex. If the pattern appears early in the trend, the price will continue the previous trend. However, if a symmetrical triangle appears in the later stage of the trend, it is more likely to act as a reversal pattern. In any case, the three forms of the triangle need to break to determine the next trend.
