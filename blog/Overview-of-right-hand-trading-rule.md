The right hand trading method refers to buying stocks, futures, foreign exchange, gold contracts, etc. after the bottom of falling phase appears, or selling after the top of rising phase appears. This kind of action does not need to predict when the bottom and top appear, but waits for the bottom and top to appear, and then continues the trading actions.

**Overview**

The right hand trading is also called the right hemisphere theory, that is, following the trend, absolutely not going against the trend, and never predicting the future.

Representative of right hand trading rules is Gann, which is a homeopathic speculative trading method, and the most representative sayings are: "Don’t be afraid to buy high and sell low, as long as the direction has not changed, your homeopathic order is right." The right hand theory refers to sell shares after falling. Just don't predict the top and bottom, trade when clear trend shows. This is the core of right-hand trading.

**Difference from the left hand trading**

The left-hand trading method is to buy on the left side of a V-shaped decline and sell on the right side of the rise. This is a trading rule known by many investment institutions, which claims to be the case with large funds. There is no doubt that large funds are traded in this way, otherwise there will be no funds that are locked up and then cut off. Judging from experience, it can be said responsibly that the left hand trading method is a trading method that keeps guessing and dip in the middle of the decline. In a bear market, this transaction method is completely unsuitable for the safety of large capital operations, but it is more suitable for hot money and small capital to earn some knife-licking money.

**Tips to remember**

1. Maintain sufficient positions.

If you want to take the initiative and become a winner in the right-hand trading, you must first maintain enough positions. When the upward trend of the market is established and the trading opportunity comes, you should adopt a strategy of heavy positions or even full positions to maximize profit.

2. Hold the stocks.

At the beginning of right hand trading, it is difficult for ordinary investors to perceive which sectors and individual stocks will become profitable ones. Only after the market has been running for a period of time will they tell potential targets. The most effective way to trade on the right is actually to continue to hold the stock patiently.

3. Obtain enough returns.

On the basis of ensuring the above two points, then consider using the appropriate amount of chips to obtain excess returns through short-term trading methods. The purpose of this move is to, on the one hand, allow the positions held to rise while the market is rising, on the other hand, increase the amount of funds while ensuring with a stop loss strategy.

In general, the main point of the right hand trading method is to follow the trend and trade with the trend. Try to avoid the uncertainties and only bet on the clear uptrend. When the valuation of the stock market is low, don’t expect to buy at the lowest price. Instead, after the bottom is formed, you should buy the stock at the next lowest price and hold it all the way till it reaches a satisfying price.

**Advantages and disadvantages**

Advantages

1. Being able to obtain relatively stable income for a long period of time is a reliable profit-making method for many investors (usually, the annual return rate is generally not lower than 20%).

2. It is suitable for mid-term investors or traders who cannot guarantee daily trading for various reasons (so it is more suitable for amateur traders and traders with low risk tolerance).

Defects:

1. Can not maximize profits (chopping head to tail);

2. It is not suitable for more aggressive investors and may lose some short-term investment opportunities (because it often takes a long time to wait--be patient to wait for the bottom confirmation before buying stocks; after buying stocks, you must wait patiently for the top confirmation. It involves a lot of waiting).
