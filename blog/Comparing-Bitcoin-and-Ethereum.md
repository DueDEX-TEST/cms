Bitcoin and Ethereum are the two most well-known cryptocurrencies today and their market capitalization are also ranking top two among digital currencies. The former is a traditional cryptocurrency created by the anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, and the latter was proposed by Vitalik Buterin in 2013.

Although the two cryptocurrencies have some similarities, their designs are quite different, and their network applications are tailored for different use cases. Now DueDEX has launched ETH contracts, so let’s talk more about the difference to facilitate your trading.

The main difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum lies in their conceptual design. Bitcoin is expected to become a safe and censorship-resistant value system outside the traditional financial field, while Ethereum is designed as a "decentralized computer system", which is Turing complete and allow users to use the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) to build applications.

**Transaction design**

Both Bitcoin and Ethereum use public-private key encryption technology to authenticate transactions. The transaction is effectively signed by the party holding the control of the private key to access each network BTC and ETH respectively. However, their transaction model structure is different.

Bitcoin uses a so-called "unused transaction output" （UTXO）. Transactions are linked together in the input and output chains, and the unused output represents that individuals can use "funds" (with the corresponding private key to unlock a specific amount of BTC) as input in new transactions.

Technically speaking, users do not own a specific BTC but have the right to spend a precise amount of unspent transaction output in the network.

In contrast, the account-based model used by Ethereum is more similar to traditional bank checking accounts. The address (public key) in Ethereum contains the transaction information of each "account".

In general, Bitcoin's UTXO design is useful for the broader consensus of the network, because all inputs and outputs are linked to each other, and it also provides a simpler design of interlocking accounting records that include time information in the blockchain stamp.

Ethereum chose an account-based model to save storage, get a constant light client reference. Both trading schemes are designed to adapt to the work each network is trying to accomplish.

**Monetary policy**

The differences in monetary policy are some of the most profound and often overlooked differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Bitcoin's monetary policy has been established since its creation and is subject to the upper limit of the total number of available BTC (21 million), the block reward is reduced by half approximately every four years, and the mining goal is difficult to adjust to ensure the consistent release of a block, which is 10 min for each block.

Bitcoin production is deflationary, equivalent to a decrease in issuance over time. As a result, due to the high circulation of Bitcoin and the scarcity of BTC, Bitcoin is often referred to as "digital gold." Bitcoin's firm monetary policy is one of its main advantages.

Ethereum's monetary policy is more liquid and has not yet been fully determined. Although Ethereum still uses a mining method similar to Bitcoin in its PoW scheme-and has made difficult adjustments to ensure that a block is created approximately every 12 seconds. But a recent debate has been aroused to change the monetary policy to Proof of Stake (PoS).

At present, the circulating supply of Ethereum is about 104,500,000. However, in the roadmap proposed by Ethereum 2.0, the general consensus around the PoS emission rate is between 0.5% and 2%, and permanent inflation will be distributed proportionally to ETH holders and validators.

Bitcoin's specific monetary policy has obvious advantages over Ethereum because, in the past few years, the Ethereum community has prioritized other network components instead of consolidating its monetary policy.

**Smart contract and scripts**

Bitcoin has a streamlined scripting language that can be used for a variety of useful mechanisms such as signature transactions and certain wallet functions, but the design of Ethereum clearly aims to promote Turing-complete smart contracts and decentralized applications on its network.

The final growth of Bitcoin side chains (such as RSK) should give Turing complete smart contract capability to the side chain tethered to the Bitcoin blockchain, but the side chain is still in its early stages.

Ethereum is the first smart contract platform, and its focus is on developers building applications (dApps) that run on its decentralized virtual machines. The main difference between Dapps and traditional applications is that they are censorship-resistant, and since its inception, Ethereum has seen numerous dapps ranging from prediction markets (such as Augur) to collectible games (such as Cryptokitties).

Dapps have some interesting meanings, but the current lack of scalability of public blockchain technology hinders their adoption. That’s why Ethereum is transitioning to PoS consensus so that scalable dApps can be comparable in performance to centralized App.

**Roadmap for the future**

The future roadmap of Bitcoin and Ethereum is full of innovative ideas and upgrades to core protocols.

Efficiency and privacy enhancements are the focus of many future Bitcoin upgrades, including the long-awaited incorporation of Schnorr signatures into the protocol and network layer privacy protection (such as Dandelion++).

Similarly, programmability is expected to continue to grow, providing merchants who want to use Bitcoin with a huge design space for more applications and payment functions. The proliferation of side chains like RSK and Liquid is also a trend that will be closely watched in the next few years.

The transition from Ethereum to PoS is obviously the most important development of the smart contract platform. The changes will be carried out in multiple steps, including the Constantinople upgrade and the completion of PoS Serenity, which will eventually go live.

Ethereum also has other developments, including zk-SNARK in the network which may improve the efficiency and privacy of the entire network, and building bridges with networks such as Cosmos and Polkadot in the future will help supplement the scalability of Ethereum.
