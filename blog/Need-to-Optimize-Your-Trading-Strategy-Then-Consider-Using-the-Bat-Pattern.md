The  **Bat Pattern**  is a basic harmonic pattern, and it is also praised by many traders as the most accurate harmonic pattern. This article will mainly introduce what the bat pattern is and how to use the bat pattern to profit from the foreign exchange market.
<!--truncate-->

**What is Bat Pattern?**

The harmonic pattern was proposed by H.M. Gartley in 1932, and was further developed by Larry Pesavento. Harmonic patterns are based on geometric calculations and Fibonacci ratios, including ABCD patterns, Gartley patterns, bat patterns, crab patterns, etc.

Harmonic pattern is a powerful technical analysis tool because it can consider previous price movements and predict future price movements. Usually traders use harmonic patterns as indicators of market continuation and reversal.

The Bat Pattern is the same as other harmonic forms, with 5 main points-X, A, B, C, D. Their outlines are almost the same, the difference is only the Fibonacci ratio that defines the main points.

Taking the picture above as an example, the bat pattern usually consists of the following parts:

l XAâ€”This is the first leg of the bat pattern. Since the bat pattern is a reversal pattern, its trend is opposite to the current market trend. If the current market is bearish, then XA will rise; if the current market is bullish, then XA will fall.

l AB is a correction to XA, and the operating target should be 38.2% or 50.0% retracement of XA.

l BC is a further test of the market in the direction of XA, but does not exceed point A. Its operating target is 38.2% or 88.6% retracement of AB.

l CD-C point is the entry point of the bat pattern. If the BC operating target is the 38.2% retracement of AB, then the CD operating target should be the 161.8% extension of BC. Correspondingly, if the BC operating target is the 88.6% retracement of AB, then the CD operating target should be the 261.8% extension of BC.

Note: Due to the difference in available prices, 5-10% error can be allowed when calculating the bat pattern with Fibonacci ratio. But in general, the following rules should not be broken:

-   The length of AB and BC remain the same
-   Point C must be within the range of AB
-   CD's target should not exceed XA's 88.6% retracement level.
-   Point D is the 161.8% or 261.8% extension of BC

XA is the first reversal signal released by the bat pattern. It appears after a bearish trend and creates a new price high.

From the chart above, we can see that the price has formed a bullish bat pattern. Now, you can enter the venue according to the following rules:

-   Observe the market from point X to point D, wait for the reversal candle to be formed at point D, and enter the market immediately.
-   In the bat pattern, the XA leg is the first signal released by the trend reversal, and it is essential for determining the stop loss level.
-   Once the price drops below point X, the bat pattern is broken. Therefore, set the stop loss below X points and set a buffer of 10-15 points.
-   Plot the Fibonacci retracement level from point A to point D. At the 61.8% retracement level of AD, the position is halved and the stop loss is moved to the break-even point. After that, you can choose to close all positions at point A according to market conditions, or wait for the price to rise further.
-   Take profit can be set at 61.8% of CD, 127.2% retracement level, XA line predicted from point D.

**Bearish bat pattern trading strategy**

Like the bullish bat pattern, XA must be determined first, because it is the first signal released by the market reversal, and other signals depend on it.

From the chart above, we can see that the price has formed a bearish bat pattern. Now, you can enter the market according to the following rules:

n Observe the market from point X to point D, wait for the reversal candle to be formed at point D, enter the market and go short immediately.

n Once the price breaks through X point, the bat pattern will be impacted. Therefore, set the stop loss level above X points and set a buffer of 10-15 points.

n Plot the Fibonacci retracement level from point A to point D. At the 61.8% retracement level of AD, the position is halved and the stop loss is moved to the break-even point. After that, you can choose to close all positions at point A according to market conditions, or wait for the price to fall further.

n Take profit can be set at 61.8% of CD, 127.2% retracement level, XA line predicted from point D.
