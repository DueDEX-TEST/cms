The Fibonacci offset line (Fibonacci retracement line), also known as the golden section line. What is the reason?

The criteria for dividing these levels (also known as Fibonacci levels) is the correlation ratio of Fibonacci sequences: 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89 144. This sequence contains many unique mathematical features that can be applied in various fields of human life.

The key Fibonacci ratio is 61.8%, also known as the "golden ratio". The golden ratio is calculated by dividing one of the following numbers (e.g.: 34/55). This numerical relationship is the basis of the retracement study.

By drawing the Fibonacci retracement line on the price chart and extending the retracement line through the current market price, you can find each potential retracement point and adjust your trading strategy based on this feedback.

**Using Fibonacci callbacks to predict the future trend**

When the price pulls up, the drawback level shows the possible support and resistance levels. If the price is below the callback level and the trend shows upward momentum, you may want to consider the next Fibonacci level as a potential future resistance level.

If it is a downward trend, you must take the opposite approach. When there is a downward trend, each Fibonacci retracement level can determine the potential support level of the market where the trader starts to buy the cryptocurrency, thus reversing the downward trend.

In this picture, the analysis is based on a 1-hour chart. You can see that the market has fallen from the most recent high and then tested the previous support before reversing. In this example, we start to draw the Fibonacci retracement line from the lowest low to the highest high, which automatically establishes the callback price level. Note that the prices are reacting to varying degrees at each Fibonacci level starting from 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8% (golden ratio figures). When reaching 78.6%, the price really starts to rise to continue an upward trend.

**Fibonacci extension line**

Note that the 1.618 Fibonacci extension line is a highly bullish level, called the golden ratio line. You can use this Fibonacci extension line in the following 2 useful ways:

1. Traders use the extension line as the focus area. The 1.618 extension line can measure the natural price changes that always occur on the chart. If you have learned about this level by using your Fibonacci expansion tool, you can use this level to set a goal. Many traders find it difficult to know where to make a profit and find that despite increasing the stop loss, they can only get very little profit. Understanding these expanded numbers helps predict areas where prices may change, especially when the market is in line with potential trends.

2. Positioning when prices have naturally changed to 1.618 Fibonacci numbers, a weak price area may occur. This can be very useful when a trader sees a trend and is looking for a way to enter the trend. One way is to wait for the price to pull back to the 1.618 expansion level and look for signals that indicate that the price can continue the potential trend for a longer period of time.

**Set stop orders based on Fibonacci retracement**

Traders use Fibonacci retracements as a guideline for placing stop-loss limit orders. E.g.: When the price is in an upward trend and you hold a long position, one of the considerations is to set the stop-loss point below the recent low. Since the low sometimes becomes a support level, the falling price may rise again before actually breaking below the previous support level.

When trading is on a downward trend and you are holding a short position, the usual method is to set the stop loss point above the recent volatility high, because this will indicate potential resistance.

**Closing words**

The Fibonacci retracement line is usually used for trend trading strategies. The Market tends to retrace a period of previous trends before reversing. Once the price starts to retrace, traders can use the Fibonacci levels on the chart to look for signs of a possible reversal.

The Fibonacci retracement line can clearly identify the starting point and falling point of any price changes and help traders to set the retracement level. Once either condition is met, the trend will likely fall back and reverse or continue its movement in reverse. Practices have proved that these reversals mostly occur near the Fibonacci retracement level.

In the downtrend, the Fibonacci strategy can help traders determine the best time to short; similarly, in the uptrend, it can be used as the best buying indicator during a retracement.
