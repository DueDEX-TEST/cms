There are various types of cryptocurrency in the market that has more or less relations to bitcoin, such as Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold etc. These coins are launched through a process called bitcoin fork. Today we will give a brief introduction of what is Bitcoin fork.

## What is a fork?

A fork is making changes to the software and protocol of a crypto currency that creates two separate versions of the blockchain and sets a new rule for the newly-created crypto currency.

As Bitcoin became more popular than before, it has become more and more packed due to limitations such as block size, consensus mechanism and other technical specifications, and people are thinking of improving its functionality. To elevate the performance of the blockchain system, the software itself needs to be updated and this caused the fork.

## Hard fork and soft fork

Bitcoin.org has defined hard forks and soft forks:

**Hard fork**: A permanent divergence in the blockchain, commonly occurs when non-upgraded nodes can’t validate blocks created by upgraded nodes that follow newer consensus rules.

**Soft fork:**  A temporary fork in the blockchain which commonly occurs when miners using non-upgraded nodes violate a new consensus rule.

This definition is quite ambiguous but the major change that the industry has agreed upon is that a hard fork will create a brand new blockchain while a soft fork maintain the uniqueness of the blockchain. In the hard fork situation, miners will choose to either update or not, so they will be separated to be miners for the new blockchain and the previous one. While in the soft fork situation, all miners are still working on the same blockchain whether they are updating the software or not.

## History of bitcoin fork

After launched in 2009, Bitcoin has experienced several forks.

#### First Soft Fork

Bitcoin’s first soft fork disabled a protocol feature, OP_RETURN. Without a lot of participants in the bitcoin during that time, the upgrade did not cause a blockchain fork.

#### First Hard Fork

The most agreed hard fork splitting bitcoin happened on 1 August 2017, resulting in a hard fork from Bitcoin Core and the creation of Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin cash (BCH) now is currently the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization and the most prominent in the dozens of different bitcoin forks.

#### Bitcoin Cash Fork

In 2018, a disagreement within the Bitcoin Cash community forked the Bitcoin Cash blockchain into Bitcoin ABC and Bitcoin SV. The Bitcoin ABC who is bigger than its competitor, maintained the name “Bitcoin Cash,” though it is now also referred to as “Bitcoin Cash ABC.” Whereas, Bitcoin SV has grown to the top 10 crypto currency in the world.

There are a lot of other hard forks around the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018 with the crypto bullish market, such as Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Diamond. But most of them have disappeared in the eyes of the public with the market turning into bearish.

## Closing thoughts

The bitcoin fork is a vivid reflection of the value and defect of the entire crypto industry. However, it proves that in a decentralized network there is no single entity can dominate the whole bitcoin network. Each participant can participate in decision making and make impacts on the development. On the other hand, the industry is full of profit-pursuit and greed. Regardless of any technical improvements on blockchain technology, each fork coin has claimed that they have made the truth behind is making profit.

Each trader should be careful with the forked coin and think twice before making any investments.
