**Initial Margin**

You can use leverage to open a Perpetual Contract position, which means you only need to put some margin to start. For example, if you would like to open a position of 10BTC, the leverage is 100x, the initial margin =10/100=0.1BTC.

**Maintenance Margin**

Maintenance Margin is the minimum amount required to continue holding a position from getting liquidated. For example, if you hold a position of 10BTC, the Maintenance Margin rate is 0.5%, then you should keep 10*0.5%=0.05BTC from being liquidated.
