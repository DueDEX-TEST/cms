The terms overbought and oversold uses to describe price movements during a period of time. It uses moving average convergence divergence and momentum oscillator to discover the overbought and oversold levels of the market so that to find trading opportunities.

<!--truncate-->


Overbought is to describe that the market for a certain stock is so sought after by too many people that the stock price increases excessively, and the stock price itself deviates significantly from its real value. However, after a sharp rise, when the high level of support is insufficient, the price may be technically adjusted downward.

Oversold describes a market or a stock that is sold by too many people, causing the stock price to dump. The stock price itself is significantly lower than its real value. However, after a sharp fall, the pressure of selling will be greatly reduced to a lower level, and prices may rebound technically.

After the stock is overbought, the stock price is too high and lacks propulsion to grow continuously. As a result, the stock price will turn around and fall. Similarly, after the stock is oversold, the stock price deviates significantly from its reasonable value and becomes very cheap, eventually attracting some people with better marketing sensitiveness to take advantage of the bargain.

According to the theory of supply and demand in economics, the reasonable value of a commodity is determined by the supply and demand in the market. But sometimes due to some reasons, a sudden large amount of short-term demand or supply in the market will lead to over-bought or over-sold shares.

However, the market status of overbought or oversold will not last. Some investment strategies are to make the opposite trading decision while the market is oversold or overbought to achieve profitability.

To determine whether the market is overbought or oversold, you can refer to the technical analysis data of the Strength Index (RSI). If the RSI is greater than 80, it means that the market is overbought; if the RSI is less than 20, it means that the market is oversold.

**Two most common overbought and oversold indicators**

**KDJ**

The KDJ indicator is a Stochastics oscillator. The main theoretical basis of KDJ is: when the price rises, the closing price tends to be close to the upper end of the current price range; on the contrary, in a downward trend, the closing price tends to be close to the lower end of the current price range.

The KDJ fully considers the random amplitude of price fluctuations and the calculation of short-term fluctuations in its design, making its short-term market measurement function more accurate and effective than the moving average, and it is relatively more accurate in the prediction of short-term overbought and oversold in the market.

1. Raw Stochastic Value (RSV) = (closing price-lowest price in N days) / (highest price in N days-lowest price in N days) *100

2.K=RSV M1 Day of moving average

3. D=K M2 day of moving average

4. N is usually set to 9 days, M1 is set to 3 days, and M2 is set to 3 days.

1. The K and D values are always between 0 and 100. D>80, the market is overbought; D<20, the market is oversold.

2. When the K>D, and the market in an uptrend, if the K line breaks up the D line, it is a buy signal; when the K<D, and the market in a downtrend, so the K line goes down and breaks D line, it is a sell signal.

3. K line and D line cross over 70 and below 30, so it is more reliable to buy and sell. If the KD golden cross occurs below 20, it is the best buying point; if the KD death cross occurs above 80, it is the best selling point.

**RSI**

Relative strength indicator RSI is a technical curve made according to the ratio of the sum of rising points and falling points in a certain period. It can reflect the prosperity of the market in a certain period.

N-day RS=[A÷B]×100%

In the formula, A-the sum of the N-day closing increases

B-the sum of N-day closing declines

N day RSI=A/(A+B)×100

RSI uses the price changes in a specific period to predict the future direction of price changes and shows the strength of the market based on the price fluctuations.

The variation range of RSI is between 0-100, and generally,70-100 is used by traders as an overbought zone and is regarded as a sell signal or point to short; while 0-30 is treated as an oversold area and is regarded as a buy signal or point to long. The 30-70 zone is a waiting area and traders should wait for a more clear signal before the next steps.
