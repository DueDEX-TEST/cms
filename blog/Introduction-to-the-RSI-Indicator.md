The Relative Strength Index (RSI), that was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr in 1970s is a useful tool to conduct price and market trend analysis. It has been widely used by traders in traditional markets and in crypto trading. Today, we will cover the basics of RSI to facilitate your trades.

## What is RSI?

The RSI is a price indicator which represents the magnitude and speed of price changes, so that it can be used to analyze the overbought or oversold situation to find proper buy and sell timing. The RSI is displayed as an oscillator and the magnitude ranges from 0 to 100. The market is considered as overbought when the RSI is above 70 and it is oversold when it is below 30.

## Calculation

The calculation involves two major components: Average Gain and Average Loss. The calculation is mainly taking 14 periods into consideration. Traders are using other time duration for more flexible use. The calculation is seen below:

**RSI = 100 - 100/(1+Average Gain/Average Lossï¼‰**

The first calculation for average gain and average loss are 14 periods averages:

First Average Gain: Sum of Gains over the past 14 days/14

First Average Loss: Sum of Losses over the past 14 days/14

The gains and losses after that are:

**Average Gain = [(previous Average Gain)x13 + current Gain]/14**

**Average Loss = [(previous Average Loss)x13 + current Loss]/14**

For example, the closing price is higher than the opening price in the 10 out of the past 14 days with an average gain of 2% while the remaining 4 days closed lower with the average loss of -1%. Therefore, the first RSI calculates as:

## How is RSI used?

As mentioned above, the RSI is an indicator that traders can use to measure the overbought and oversold rate of the market. When the indicator increases and the price is going up, it shows that the market is an active buying market. Meanwhile, if the indicator increases but the price is moving downwards, it means that the market suffers a potential selling pressure.

As seen in the calculation above, the RSI oscillates from 0 to 100. An RSI score of 30 or less suggests that the asset is oversold while a 70 or higher indicates that the asset price is near its peak during that period.

RSI can also be used to predict the market trend to identify supports and resistances. A bullish divergence is recognized when RSI score moves in opposite directions. For instance, the RSI increases while the price falls, which means that the buying force in the market is getting stronger despite the price going down. Therefore, bearish divergence is identified when the RSI score drops while the price is going up, showing a weakening buying force in an uptrend market. The sell signal takes place when the price reaches a new high but the RSI is at a lower high while the buy signal takes place when the price reaches a new low but the RSI is at a higher low.

## Limitations

When the market stays in a strong trend, the RSI loses its usefulness. In a strong downtrend market, there might be many bullish divergences before the actual bottom and in this case, the RSI analysis may be no longer useful. Therefore, RSI is more suitable to be used in an oscillating market when the price is changing between bullish and bearish.

## Closing Words

The Relative Strength Index indicator is a useful tool for traders to use when doing technical analysis. Key takeaways here would be the 30-70 oversold/overbought indicators and its signal for bullish/bearish divergences. However, as most of the market theories, it cannot be perfectly suited for all market situations.
