**Overview**

The so-called left-hand trading is simply a buy-low and sell-high transaction. At the stage when the stock is about to fall to the bottom, it gradually buys in, and then sells profitable positions in the process of rebounding. However, this kind of operation has relatively high technical requirements, so when we analyze, we should do a very careful research.

Characteristics of the left-hand transaction: This is the market area mainly controlled by the individuals with big capital and the institutions. In this area, these major players are building up their positions while the ordinary traders are cutting the meat. The essence of left hand trading is to buy low and sell high.

**Tips when using left hand trading**

First of all, reduce your trading operations, and make a detailed trading plan before making moves.

Secondly, it is necessary to set a stop loss point and pay attention to risk control. The risk of left-hand trading is something that you can control.

Thirdly, learn to admit mistakes. No one can make every transaction successful. Once the market trend is found to be inconsistent with your earlier judgment, you should quickly adjust your strategy.

And last but not the least, learn to build positions in a pyramid style and ship them in an inverted pyramid style. You can decide the stage and proportion of the pyramid according to your own funds and risk tolerance. For example, splitting your position building into four stages with 10%, 20%, 30% and 40% of all your funds. For selling, you can choose the opposite method.

**Prerequisites to use left hand theory**

1. The funds that we use must be spare funds, that is to say, funds that are never likely to be used, or funds that will not be used to meet all of your daily life needs. Loan funds, pension funds, and living funds are not suitable for left-hand transactions. Of course, such funds are not suitable for entering the trading market, even if the right hand trading is used.

2. Ability to tolerate floating losses. The margin of safety is a range, not a very accurate point. Therefore, it is normal that the stocks will fall slightly after purchasing.

Nearly no one can enter the market at the exact lowest point. We can adopt the method of opening positions gradually. The core value of left hand trading is not relying trading on turns and changes of market trend.

3. Hold for a long time with stop loss applied. The logic here is that when you buy something at a low price, the market rule determines that cheap and unreasonable prices cannot exist for a long time. Of course, we can buy stocks that have potential in the future but are cheaper now, and there is naturally more room for appreciation in the future.

**Real-time practice**

In understanding the left hand trading theory, we recommend that investors should be flexible. First, pay close attention to the timeliness of the trend when using the left-hand trading, because the trend can be divided into short-term trend, mid-term trend, and long-term trend according to the time duration. Different types of trading durations should have corresponding trading strategies.

For example, in the short-term trend, since the focus is on speed and accuracy, and the left hand transaction that takes a long time to verify is easy for us to make mistakes. It is not appropriate to adopt the left hand transaction at this time, but should be adjusted to the right side transaction.

Second, investors should also pay attention to the condition of the market, whether itâ€™s in a long or short position. If the market is bearish and people are lacking confidence in a long market, then it is extremely risky to trade on the left.
