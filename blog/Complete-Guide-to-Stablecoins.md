Stablecoins are known as the bridge between the cryptocurrency markets and the real world. As most tradersâ€™ step one in the crypto world, they usually have to exchange their fiat to stablecoins and then make other trades from there. Although crypto traders are more or less using them for their trades, yet nearly no one has a detailed understanding of them. Today we will give a complete guide to stablecoins to provide a clearer picture of what they are, and relevant tips when using them.

## **What are Stablecoins?**

A Stablecoin is a cryptocurrency pegged to another asset. The most common stablecoin is fiat-backed, which means the value of them is based on the value of the backing currency. Fiat-backed stablecoins are usually used to be traded on exchanges and are claimed to be redeemable from the issuer. The amount of the issued stablecoin and the supply of tokens is equivalent to the amount of the corresponding fiat.

The advantage of stablecoins are that they have mixed the advantages of fiat and cryptocurrency. On the one hand, they are cryptocurrency supported by blockchain, which ensures cryptographic security, ability to transfer assets digitally and fast transactions. Furthermore, by being pegged to a fiat, it has a rather stable value, which is extremely helpful in a highly volatile market.

## **The Function of Stablecoins**

As mentioned above, stablecoins act as the bridge to connect traditional markets. Detailed aspects of this bridge-like functions are:

Providing cryptocurrency trading pairs with better stability. Pegged to a fiat currency with a stable value, stable coins-formed trading pairs are more intuitive and straight-forward than other trading pairs that are often leveraged by exchanges such as to BTC, to ETH, whose price is also variable.

Making daily transactions, as effortlessly as fiat. As a payment method with better privacy and security, crypto transactions are more utilized by more people as channels for online payments. Stablecoins are facilitating this process with a fixed price.

## **Popular Stablecoins**

#### **Tether (USDT)**

Tether is the largest and most well-known stablecoin. It is nearly supported by all major exchanges around the world so Tether has turned into a quick and cheap way of transferring fund from one exchange to another. It is pegged to the US dollar and with a 1:1 ratio in terms of value.

Tether has grown with a lot of controversy. In mid-2018, several fraud allegations pulled down Tether price from 1 to 0.85 USD. However, it turned back to normal quickly and retained the top position of the market.

#### **USD Coin (USDC)**

USDC is issued by Circle, pegged to the US dollar in a 1:1 ratio and is available on all the major crypto exchanges. USDC is an ERC-20 token that runs on the Ethereum network and reserved asset for USDC are audited every month by accounting firm Grant Thornton.

#### **Dai (DAI)**

Different from the two types of stablecoins above, DAI is backed by collateral on the Maker platform. It runs on Ethereum under smart contract. So it is considered more transparent and fair than other stablecoins without affected by any third party. The value of DAI is also 1 USD.

#### **Paxos Standard (PAX)**

Launched by the Paxos Trust Company, PAX is a regulated stablecoin that has been approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services. PAX is also ERC-20 token backed by the US dollar in a 1:1 ratio.

## **Limitations of Stablecoins**

Although widely leveraged in the crypto world, stablecoins are criticized with several drawbacks.

Even though using blockchain, a decentralized technology, stablecoins are considered centralized due to its issuance and management mechanism. The accountability of the issuance is only determined by the organization itself or some external third party audit, like a central bank and failing to be decentralized.

This audit process has also put extra regulation pressure on stablecoins, which shades off the legal freedom of crypto currency.

## **Stablecoins in Crypto Derivatives Trading**

Similar to spot trading, Stablecoins are also widely used in crypto derivatives trading. The Inverse contracts use major crypto currency such as BTC, ETH as base currency. The contract quantity is calculated in USD (Quoted currency), and then use their base currency to calculate margin, profit and loss.

This means that if a trader wants to trade BTCUSD inverse contract, he or she needs to deposit BTC to the platform. The defect is that the trader has to suffer unnecessary loss when profiting with short positions.

Contract using stablecoins as base currency and BTC, ETH, etc. as quoted currency can solve the problem since profit/loss and margin are all calculated in USD. Users are holding stablecoins to take part in the contract trading like this.

The contract type that DueDEX is currently supporting is inverse contract. The contract that settled in USD will be supported soon. Traders then will be able to trade on DueDEX with stablecoins.
