John Murphy is a mentor in the minds of technical analysis enthusiasts and technical analysts. They regard Murphy's "Futures Market Technical Analysis" as a book and a must-read for introduction. By analyzing price patterns and price moves, traders are able to make predictions of price trends and find potential trading opportunities. Here are Murphy's ten rules of technical trading:

<!--truncate-->

1.Research and judge major trends

Study long-term graphics. First, start with the monthly and weekly charts that span several years to do graphical analysis. A longer time span can provide greater visibility and a better long-term vision for a certain market.

After knowing the long-term trend, we can analyze the daily and intraday charts. Individual short-term market analysis is often deceptive. Even if you only trade short-term and follow the direction of the medium-term trend and the long-term trend, your success rate will be higher.

2.Find the trend and follow them

Find the trend and follow it. Market trends have several scales: long-term, medium-term, and short-term. First decide which type of trade you want to do, and then choose the appropriate graph. Determine which trend you are trading in. If the trend is up, buy when the pullback occurs. If the trend is down, sell/short when rebounding.

If you are trading mid-term trends, use daily and weekly charts. If you are an intraday trader, use daily and intraday charts. However, no matter what kind of situation it belongs to, the longer-term graph should be used to determine the trend, and then the shorter-term graph should be used to select the timing of entry and exit.

3.Find the highs and lows

Find support and resistance levels. The best place to buy is near the support level, which is often a previous low. The best position for short selling is near the resistance level, which is usually a previous high.

After a resistance high is broken, it tends to provide support for subsequent pullbacks. In other words, the old "highs" become new "lows". By the same token, when a support level is broken, it will often become a short selling point for a future rebound-the old "low" can become a new "high".

4.Know the magnitude of the retracement

Calculate the percentage of the retracement trend. The market tends to retrace a large part of the original trend when it corrects upward or downward. You can use a simple percentage to estimate the retracement of an existing trend.

The 50% retracement of the previous trend is the most common. The smallest retracement is usually one-third of the previous trend. The largest retracement is usually two-thirds. The 38% and 62% Fibonacci retracements are also worth watching. Therefore, during the correction of the upward trend, the first buying point should be in the 33-38% retracement zone.

5.Draw a trend line

Draw a trend line. Trend line is one of the simplest and most effective graphical analysis tools. All you need is a straightedge and two points on the graph. The uptrend line is drawn by connecting two consecutive low points, and the downtrend line is drawn by connecting two consecutive high points.

Prices usually pull back to the trend line and then continue the upward trend. Breaking the trend line is often a signal of a trend change. A valid trend line should be touched at least 3 times. The longer the trend line is valid, the more times it is tested, and the higher its importance becomes.

6.Follow the moving average

Follow the moving average. Moving averages can provide objective buy and sell signals. They can tell you whether existing trends are still in progress, and they can also help confirm trends. However, moving averages will not tell you in advance that a trend is about to change. Combining two moving averages is the most common way to find trading signals.

Some common futures product moving average combinations are 4 days and 9 days, 9 days and 18 days, 5 days and 20 days. The signal occurs when the shorter-term moving average crosses the longer-term moving average. Prices above or below the 40-day moving average can also provide very good trading signals. Since the moving average is a trend-following indicator, it is most effective in a market that has a clear trend.

7.Foresee turning points

Track oscillatory indicators. Oscillators help to identify overbought and oversold markets. Moving averages can confirm changes in market trends, while oscillatory indicators can often warn us in advance that a certain market has risen or fallen too far, and an inflection point is about to occur. The most commonly used oscillators are the relative strength index (RSI) and stochastic indicators.

The range of the two indicators is 0-100. For RSI, readings above 70 are overbought, and readings below 30 are oversold. The overbought and oversold values ​​of Stochastics are 80 and 20. Deviations from oscillating indicators are often warning signs of market turn.

These tools are most effective in fluctuating markets. The weekly chart signal can be used as a filter for the daily chart signal, and the daily chart signal can be used as a filter for the intraday chart signal.

8.Know the warning signs

Use MACD indicator. The Moving Average Convergence and Divergence (MACD) indicator combines the overbought/oversold functions of the moving average crossing system and the oscillatory indicator. When the fast line crosses the slow line from below and both lines are below zero, a buy signal appears; when the fast line crosses the slow line from above and both lines are above zero, a sell signal appears.

The signals on the weekly chart have priority over the signals on the daily chart. MACD's histogram reflects the difference between the two lines, which can give an earlier warning signal of trend changes.

9.Trend or oscillation

Use ADX indicator. The Average Movement Index (ADX) can help us determine whether a certain market is in a clear trend or a volatile market. It measures the degree of trend or the direction of the market. An increase in ADX means that there is a strong trend, and a decrease means that it belongs to a volatile market without a clear trend.

When ADX rises, it should be used with the moving average, and when ADX falls, it should be used with the oscillation indicator. Through the direction of the ADX line, traders can decide which trading style to adopt and which indicators are most suitable for the current market environment.

10.Understand the signal

Including trading volume and interest in positions. In the futures market, trading volume and interest in positions are important signals. The volume is ahead of the price. We must be sure that volume amplification occurs in the direction of the dominant trend. In an uptrend, heavy volume should occur during an up trading day.

Position interest can confirm whether new funds support existing trends. Declining interest in positions usually indicates a warning signal that a trend is closing to an end. A solid price upward trend should be supported by rising trading volume and rising interest in positions.
