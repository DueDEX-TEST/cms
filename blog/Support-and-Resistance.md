One of the most common terms that you will hear in technical analysis or when looking at a chart are the support and resistance levels. The concept of support and resistance is very easy to understand but difficult to apply and master. The reason why this is important for traders is because it provides the current range of the price movement and anything that breaks through each could signal a new trend or a change in behavior of the price. Let us go and learn more about this.

What is Support and Resistance?

Where the forces of the demand and supply meet is where you find the support and resistance levels. It is the level at which the price stops moving in one direction or changes direction. What do we mean by this? A support shows the level of demand for a security or a blockchain which is strong enough not to go down further, we may refer to it as the floor price or lowest price it could possibly go in a given range or time. While resistance on the other hand, shows the supply at which it limits the buyers to buy when reached. It could somehow be related to a ceiling price or highest price of the range.

It is important to note that support and resistance levels can be structured in different ways. Traders associate and use indicators such as moving averages, trend lines, key price levels and previous highs and lows to identify the support and resistance at a given period.

_Why is Support and Resistance important?_

Support and Resistance are important for traders because it signals them at which price it is good to enter and when to exit. For instance, the BTCUSDâ€™s Support and Resistance within the past 6 hours is 6620 and 6810 respectively. With this information, a trader would more likely enter a long trade when the pair drops at or near the 6620 level and would be likely to sell and take profit at or near the 6810 level. The psychology behind this is because the trader would think that when it hits 6810, it would be more likely to go down again unless a breakthrough happens.

By understanding the support and resistance level, traders could make profitable trading decisions within a short-term period, identify market trends,

In cases like below, where there is a breakthrough but the price went back to the previous support and resistance level range, it is said to just be testing the levels.

However, when the price breaks through a support or a resistance level and continuously does so, it is a signal of a new trend and it means that a new support and resistance level is created. See example below for illustration.
